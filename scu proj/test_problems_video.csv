Example 2:


Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
Example 3:

Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.
