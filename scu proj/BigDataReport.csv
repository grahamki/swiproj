8,"Can you write python code to solve “String to Integer (atoi)”?  Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer. The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows: Whitespace : Ignore any leading whitespace ( "" "" ). Signedness : Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present. Conversion : Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0. Rounding : If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2 31, 2 31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range.

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values: Symbol Value I 1 V 5 X 10 L 50 C 100 D 500 M 1000 Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules: If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral. If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 ( I ) less than 5 ( V ): IV and 9 is 1 ( I ) less than 10 ( X ): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 ( IV ), 9 ( IX ), 40 ( XL ), 90 ( XC ), 400 ( CD ) and 900 ( CM ). Only powers of 10 ( I, X, C, M ) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 ( V ), 50 ( L ), or 500 ( D ) multiple times.

The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used: I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order). For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2]. Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2]. While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

736,"Can you write python code to solve “Parse Lisp Expression”?  You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of. The syntax for these expressions is given as follows. An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer. (An integer could be positive or negative.) A let expression takes the form ""(let v 1 e 1 v 2 e 2... v n e n expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v 1 is assigned the value of the expression e 1, the second variable v 2 is assigned the value of the expression e 2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr. An add expression takes the form ""(add e 1 e 2 )"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e 1, e 2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e 1 and the evaluation of e 2. A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e 1 e 2 )"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e 1, e 2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2. For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names. Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer. A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"". Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""]. The format of the output is as follows: For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"". Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term. For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4. The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed. An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""]. Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.

In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h ) you will travel at. After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting. For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait. However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks. For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours.

You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise. You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator. If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string ""Cancelled"" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed. When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.
