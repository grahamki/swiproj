Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer. The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows: Whitespace : Ignore any leading whitespace ( "" "" ). Signedness : Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present. Conversion : Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0. Rounding : If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2 31, 2 31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2 31 should be rounded to -2 31, and integers greater than 2 31 - 1 should be rounded to 2 31 - 1. Return the integer as the final result.

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values: Symbol Value I 1 V 5 X 10 L 50 C 100 D 500 M 1000 Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules: If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral. If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 ( I ) less than 5 ( V ): IV and 9 is 1 ( I ) less than 10 ( X ): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 ( IV ), 9 ( IX ), 40 ( XL ), 90 ( XC ), 400 ( CD ) and 900 ( CM ).

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

636,"Can you write python code to solve “Exclusive Time of Functions”?

On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1. Function calls are stored in a call stack : when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp. You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the i th log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively. A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.

An add expression takes the form ""(add e 1 e 2 )"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e 1, e 2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e 1 and the evaluation of e 2.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num. For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal. For example, if the game ended with num = ""243801"", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1.

2650,"Can you write python code to solve “Design Cancellable Function”?

Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise. You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator. If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string ""Cancelled"" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed. When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error. An example of how your code would be used: function* tasks() { const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2)); yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done. } const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks()); setTimeout(cancel, 50); promise.catch(console.log); // logs ""Cancelled"" at t=50ms If instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.

Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing. 



Example 2: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(""Hello"")); throw `Error: ${msg}`; } cancelledAt = null Output: {""rejected"": ""Error: Hello""} Explanation: A promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error. 



Example 3: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); return ""Success""; } cancelledAt = 100 Output: {""rejected"": ""Cancelled""} Explanation: While the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error.

Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise.

However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise. 



Example 6: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { try { yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(""Promise Rejected"")); } catch(e) { let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); return a + b; }; } cancelledAt = null Output: {""resolved"": 4} Explanation: The first yielded promise immediately rejects.

You are given m x n grid image which represents a grayscale image, where image[i][j] represents a pixel with intensity in the range [0..255]. You are also given a non-negative integer threshold. Two pixels are adjacent if they share an edge. A region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold. All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions. You need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9. Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.
